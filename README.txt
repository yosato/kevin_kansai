okay, I'm now in github. You could git-fetch me from here, or pip me.

Again, there's the 2/3 thing, and I'm always in Python 3. so if necessary, check your pip, then,

<your-pip-3> install pythonlib-ys git+https://github.com/yosato/myPythonLibs.git -U

you could add --user to install it in your home.
